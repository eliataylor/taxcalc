# *What if taxes were based on **Net Worth** instead of Annual Income?*

- **Pros**: Encourage circulation of money supply :)
- **Cons**: Encourages consumerism :(

**One goal** for this calculator is to build a fair tax schedule that earns at least as much as our current Federal Budget.

**One challenge** is how to define "Net Worth" for Individuals, Banks, and Corporations. Our current definition for Individual's Net Worth is based on these 5 variables:

- **Checking Account Balance**  
  This only includes easily accessible capital.
  
- **Savings Account Balance**  
  This includes long term accounts with early withdrawal penalties like IRAs and CDs.
  
- **Overseas Balance**  
  This is to prevent offshoring money to avoid taxes.
  
- **Occupied Property**  
  This would be a lower tax rate on land value, when the land is occupied similar to the overall area's density, given other uses like agriculture and industry.
  
- **Vacant Property**  
  This would be a higher rate to prevent parking large capital in vacant land.

**Other challenges** are how [incorporate debt](https://chatgpt.com/share/67fc7aa3-c9a4-800e-9d84-d9e9e0a847a4), how to treat capital controlled by Banks and Corporations, and of course how to implement this over time.
